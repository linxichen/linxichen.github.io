Welcome to my site. I am a New York based Quantitative Researcher. I got my Econ Ph.D. from Duke and now working on various interesting projects in both Finance and Macro.

I am using this site to share my work and random useful things. Feel free to leave a comment. This site is not associated with my employer in any shape or form. All opinions are mine.
